%{ 
One aspect that is difficult in modeling is finding the necessary parameter values. Create a 
MATLAB script that defines the values of at least 4 common ions found in neurons, with approximate 
mammalian extracellular and intracellular concentrations. You can use any published source you 
trust, but be sure you give credit to that source in your code. Be sure to make your work unique 
by putting your name on it and organizing it well. Also be sure to specify units and the 
associated temperature.
